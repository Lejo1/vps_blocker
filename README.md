# Vps Blocker

This mod checks the ips of the player for vpns, proxys, or other hosting services.

It gets the information from nastyhosts.com and iphub.info

Installing
----------

First you need to add vps_blocker to secure.http_mods to allow https  requests.

If you want to use iphub.info you need to register there and paste your API key in the minetest config to iphub_key = 123

Set the kick message:

vps_kick_message = "You are using a proxy, vpn or other hosting services, please disable them to play on this server."

Commands
--------

Use /vps_wl <add or remove> <name or ip> to allow people using vps.

The idea for the mod is taken from https://github.com/red-001/block_vps but it's a complete redo of it.
